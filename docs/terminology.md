| Gray Rhino     | Highly probable events, also with significant impact, yet seemingly ignored or neglected until it’s too late.  _Gray Rhinos are usually surrounded by other Gray Rhinos and aptly enough, the zoological term for a group of rhinos is a “crash”! The important difference between the Black Swan and the Gray Rhino is that, with the latter, you have a choice. As Wucker says “Either you get trampled or you get out of the way, or you can hop on the back of the rhino and use the crisis as opportunity.”_ Source: [arete.ateneo.edu: Of Black Swans and Gray Rhinos](https://arete.ateneo.edu/connect/of-black-swans-and-gray-rhinos) |

**Foreign exchange (forex) and currency trading** refers to simultaneously buying one currency and selling another, or vice versa, in the hope that one currency will strengthen against the other.

## Cross Currency Triangulation

A **cross currency** refers to a **forex transaction** that does not involve the **U.S. dollar** as a contract settlement currency. Common cross currency pairs involve the **Euro** and the **Japanese yen**.

**The basic cross exchange rate formula**

```
A/B x B/C = C/B
```

**Examples**

- EUR/GBP = EUR/USD divided by GBP/US
- GBP/CHF = GBP/USD x USD/CHF
- AUD/NZD bid = AUD/USD bid divided by NZD/USD offer = a certain rate
- AUD/NZD offer = AUD/USD offer divided by NZD/USD bid = a rate
  
## Safe Haven Currencies

Safe haven currencies are currencies that are expected to retain or increase in value during periods geopolitical macroeconomic stress.

The **U.S. dollar (USD)**, along with the **Japanese yen (JPY)** and **Swiss franc (CHF)** are considered safe-haven currencies.

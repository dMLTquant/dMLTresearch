> The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has given its full backing to the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), saying they are needed to modernize finance and ensure 'Big Tech' does not take control of money.
> 
> Dubbed the central bank to the world's central banks, the BIS, which is coordinating many of their discussions on digital currencies, set out recommendations, in June 2021, on how a CBDC such as a digital dollar, euro, yen or yuan should look.

> Seven central banks and the BIS take forward their work on retail central bank digital currencies and analyse policy options and practical implementation issues
>
> New set of reports explores how CBDCs could best meet users’ future needs through developing interoperable systems that support private innovation while preserving public trust
>
> Extensive cooperation and dialogue will be required to develop and run a CBDC, preserving the centrality of central bank money for future systems that anchor public trust and support public welfare
>
> Building on an initial report outlining foundational principles for CBDCs [published in 2020](https://www.bis.org/press/p201009.htm) Opens in a new window, the group formed by Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, Federal Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank, Swiss National Bank and BIS has now turned to practical policy and implementation issues. While none of these central banks has yet decided to proceed with a retail CBDC, they believe continuing to work on the topic is key, due to its wide-ranging implications.
